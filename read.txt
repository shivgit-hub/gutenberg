**Title:** *"The Full Stack Developer’s Balancing Act"*  

**Design:**  
- **Two sides**: Left (Development) vs. Right (BAU).

**Key Stats:**  
- *"4 hrs coding, 2 hrs meetings, 2 hrs BAU"*  
- *"5+ context switches/day"*

1. **Want me to send a pre-made slide?**  
   - I can generate a **PPTX/Google Slides** file for you—just say the word!  
2. **Need adjustments?**  
   - More/less detail? Prefer a Gantt chart? Let me know!
